"""
As I suffer from Multiple Sclerosis, I aimed at building a word cloud from the free wikipedia page tiled 'Multiple sclerosis' The result of my efforts was 100% fruitful.
I have used and tested the scripts in Python 3.9 in Jupyter Notebook.
  The outcome of my code is attached
"""
Installed the following packages
1. wordcloud
2. pillow (will later import is as PIL)
3. wikipedia

"""
In my project text, I used scraped text from a Wikipedia page on ‘Multiple sclerosis’
"""

# Import package
import wikipedia
import re
# Specify the title of the Wikipedia page
wiki = wikipedia.page('Multiple sclerosis')
# Extract the plain text content of the page
text = wiki.content
text = re.sub(r'==.*?==+', '', text)
text = text.replace('\n', '')

# Then, prepare a function that plots the word cloud
# Imported package
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
# Define a function to plot word cloud
def plot_cloud(wordcloud):
    # Set figure size
    plt.figure(figsize=(40, 30))
    # Display image
    plt.imshow(wordcloud) 
    # No axis details
    plt.axis("off");
#Then created the first word cloud and plotted it:
# Import package
from wordcloud import WordCloud, STOPWORDS
# Generate word cloud
wordcloud = WordCloud(width = 2500, height = 1500, random_state=1, background_color='blue', colormap='Pastel1', collocations=False, stopwords = STOPWORDS).generate(text)
# Plot
plot_cloud(wordcloud)
